Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. Using some Mechine Learning Algorithm modes for prediction to construct label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this sample data..
